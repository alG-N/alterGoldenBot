/**
 * Music Services
 * 
 * Architecture (Phase 2 Week 6-7):
 * - MusicFacade: Orchestrator providing backward-compatible API
 * - QueueService: Queue CRUD operations
 * - PlaybackService: Play, pause, skip, stop operations
 * - VoiceConnectionService: Voice channel connection and monitoring
 * - AutoPlayService: Similar track discovery for auto-play
 * - LavalinkService: Low-level Lavalink connection management
 * 
 * Event System (Week 7):
 * - MusicEventBus: Central event emitter for decoupled communication
 * - MusicEvents: Event name constants
 * - PlaybackEventHandler: Handles player lifecycle events
 * @module services/music
